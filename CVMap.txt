Below is a diagram of the pins on the Receiver. These are standard R/C connections, 
the pins closest to the edge of the board are ground, the pins in the middle are +3v and 
the pins nearest the chip are the signal pins.

Note that this is a THREE (3.3) volt device, do not hook 5v to it for any length of time!

   Y   X  s1  s0   D   3v
   |   |   |   |   |   |________ Power Connection (+3v)
   |   |   |   |   |____________ DCC logic level out
   |   |   |   |________________ Servo 0 (Throttle)
   |   |   |____________________ Servo 1 (Direction in Steam mode)
   |   |________________________ Digital Output X
   |____________________________ Digital Output Y


These are marked on the board.

Note that the DCC address defaults to 3. To change to any other address 
greater that 256 you must first convert the address to hex. Then take 
the upper and lower bytes and convert them to decimal. Enter those as 
address low and address high.  The same must be done for the servo limits.

Example:	1220   address or servo limit
convert:	1220 into hex is hex 04C4
upper is	04 = 4 decimal
lower is	C4 = 196 decimal
program lower first, then upper.

If you need to reset to the factory defaults and can't communicate 
with the receiver, use a jumper to connect pin 3 of the processor 
chip to ground and power up the receiver.  Remove power and the 
jumper, then power up as normal.
